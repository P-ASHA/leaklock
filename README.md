# leaklock

Passwords are a primary line of defence for securing online accounts, yet their misuse remains a significant vulnerability in cybersecurity. Many users unknowingly reuse or create weak passwords, making them susceptible to credential theft. To address this issue, the Leak lock system leverages the Have I Been Pwned API to empower users with tools to assess their password security. This Python-based application hashes user-provided passwords using the SHA-1 algorithm and checks their presence in a database of compromised credentials without exposing sensitive information. By identifying passwords that have been leaked in previous breaches, the system enables users to take immediate action to strengthen their account security. The tool is designed for individuals who prioritize cybersecurity and wish to avoid using compromised or weak passwords. Through an easy-to-use command-line interface, it promotes awareness about password security and encourages the adoption of safer authentication practices. This project underscores the importance of integrating practical tools to combat cybersecurity risks at the user level.
